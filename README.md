# `photon-quickstart`

> Cargo template for developing [photon] applications

[photon]: https://particle.io

Firmware version: v0.6.2

# Dependencies

- Embedded ARM toolchain. Any recent version should do.
  - On Windows, check
    the [GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded).
    The download links are on the left side.
  - On macOS, run `brew cask install gcc-arm-embedded`.
  - On Ubuntu, install the `gcc-arm-none-eabi`, `libnewlib-arm-none-eabi` and
    `libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib` packages.
- Rust nightly toolchain. See https://rustup.rs for installation instructions,
  or run `rustup default nightly` (or create an override) if you already have
  rustup installed.
- Xargo. `$ cargo install xargo`
- The rust-src component for the nightly channel. `$ rustup component add
  rust-src`.
- `particle-cli`. `$ npm -g install particle-cli`.
- `particle-tools`, for the `elf2bin` tool. `$ cargo install --git

# Troubleshooting

This section contains fixes for common errors encountered when using this
template.

### Forgot to install the `rust-src` component

Old error message (Xargo <=v0.3.6):

```
$ xargo build
error: couldn't walk the sysroot
caused by: IO error for operation on /home/japaric/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src: No such file or directory (os error 2)
caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace
```

New error message:

```
$ xargo build
error: `rust-src` component not found. Run `rustup component add rust-src`.
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace
```

Solution: Install the `rust-src` component using the command `rustup component
add rust-src`.

## Forgot to install the `arm-none-eabi-g++` linker

Error message:

```
$ xargo build
   Compiling my-app v0.1.0 (file:///home/japaric/tmp/my-app)
error: could not exec the linker `arm-none-eabi-g++`: No such file or directory (os error 2)
  |
  = note: "arm-none-eabi-g++" (..)
```

Solution: Install the embedded ARM toolchain. Consult your distribution / OS
package manager.

## Didn't install the `libnewlib-arm-none-eabi` package

Error message:

```
$ xargo build
   Compiling my-app v0.1.0 (file:///home/japaric/tmp/my-app)
error: linking with `arm-none-eabi-g++` failed: exit code: 1
  |
  = note: "arm-none-eabi-g++" (..)
  = note: arm-none-eabi-g++: error: nano.specs: No such file or directory
```

Solution: Install the `libnewlib-arm-none-eabi` package. This is on Ubuntu;
other distributions may call the package with a different name.

## Didn't install the `libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib` package

Error message:

```
$ xargo build
   Compiling my-app v0.1.0 (file:///home/japaric/tmp/my-app)
error: linking with `arm-none-eabi-g++` failed: exit code: 1
  |
  = note: "arm-none-eabi-g++" (..)
  = note: /usr/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/4.9.3/../../../arm-none-eabi/bin/ld: cannot find -lstdc++_nano
```

Solution: Install the `libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib` package. This is on
Ubuntu; other distributions may call the package with a different name.

## Used Cargo instead of Xargo

Error message:

```
$ cargo build
   Compiling particle-hal v0.1.0 (https://github.com/japaric/particle-hal#179f8fb8)
error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
  |
  = note: the `photon` target may not be installed

error: aborting due to previous error
```

Solution: use Xargo instead of Cargo. That is `xargo build`.

### Forgot to call the `elf2bin` tool

Error message:

```
$ particle flash $device target/..
Including:
    target/photon/release/examples/(..)
attempting to flash firmware to your device (..)
Flash device failed.
[object Object]
```

Solution: Call `elf2bin` on the Cargo output and then (`particle`) flash the
output of that script: a `.bin` file.

## Used the stable toolchain

Error message:

```
$ xargo build
   Compiling particle-hal v0.1.0 (https://github.com/japaric/particle-hal#179f8fb8)
error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
  |
  = note: the `photon` target may not be installed

error: aborting due to previous error
```

Solution: Switch to the nightly toolchain using the command `rustup default
nightly`.
